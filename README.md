### What I learned
The main objective of this project was to get hands-on experience by working with `Redux` for state management. I have previously worked on other projects where the context API was used for state management purpose. I have also gained a lot of knowledge by handling `RESTful APIs` & creating server-side applications with `nodeJs` & `ExpressJs`. Creating database models and dealing with errors with custom error middleware are also ways to gain experience.
